WHAT IT IS:

* A bingo board
* Randomizes content on each load
* Reads square data from the data.js file
* Uses data attributes to check for win condition
* Uses CSS transitions for all animation
* Uses Media Queries for optimized mobile experience
* Uses "Hide Address Bar" (via @scottjehl) to hide mobile URL bar
